        <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Ulster with a degree in Accounting and Management together with
            most up to date knowledge of the field. I am self-motivated, enthusiastic, and driven with strong team
            working
            and communication skills, enabling me to work effectively in a dynamic, result focused environment. I also
            constantly increase my knowledge whilst seeking a position, which will provide the opportunity to
            demonstrate
            skills learned at university and via work experience, and ultimately add value to an organisation.</p>
